# Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews
A repository of NLP implementations for sentiment analysis of product reviews using various transformer models and topic modeling techniques.

# Overview
This repository contains implementations of sentiment analysis pipelines for analyzing product reviews. The projects explore different approaches to natural language processing, including various preprocessing techniques, transformer-based models, and topic modeling methods to extract insights from user-generated content.

# Preprocessing Techniques
Text preprocessing is a critical step in sentiment analysis that impacts model performance. We explore various approaches:

# Raw Text Approach
Preserves all original features including punctuation, capitalization, and spacing
Maintains emotional cues like exclamation marks (!!!), ellipses (...), and emphasis
Ideal for transformer models that can interpret these nuances
Better for capturing sentiment subtleties like irony, excitement, or emphasis

# Cleaned Text Approach
Converts to lowercase to standardize text
Removes URLs and special characters
Eliminates extra whitespace
Optional stopword removal for different analysis needs
Better for traditional NLP methods and topic modeling

# Modeling Approaches

# Transformer-Based Sentiment Analysis
Fine-tuning pre-trained models (RoBERTa, BERT, DistilBERT, etc.)
Transfer learning from models pre-trained on social media content
Multi-class classification (Negative, Neutral, Positive)
Customizable for different domains (e.g., product reviews, social media posts)

# Topic Modeling
Unsupervised discovery of themes in review text
BERTopic implementation for modern transformer-based topic extraction
Cross-analysis of topics with sentiment classification
